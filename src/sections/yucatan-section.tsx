    <Subheading>The Yucatán</Subheading>
    <Paragraph>
      The Yucatán peninsula is an amazing area home to three Mexican states:
      Quintana Roo, Yucatan, and Campeche. The peninsula is quite flat and home
      to an arid jungle ecosystem on the interior and lush tropical beaches
      along the coast. It is the ancestral home of the Mayan peoples and many of
      their culture and traditions continue alongside contemporary Mexican
      culture. Many of the place names in the region are Mayan rather than
      Spanish in origin - &ldquo;<em>x</em>&rdquo; is widely used and pronounced
      like &ldquo;<em>sh</em>&rdquo; in English.
    </Paragraph>
    <Subsubheading>Culture - Cities</Subsubheading>
    <Paragraph>
      <b>Mérida</b> &mdash; is the capital of the State of the Yucatan with a
      population of 900k. It is an old colonial city with a deep history of
      financial and political power in the region. Now it is home to many
      charming restaurants, shops, and bars. It is one of the safest cities in
      all of North &amp; South America.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      <b>Cancún &amp; Tulum</b> &mdash; are two of the most famous tourist
      destinations in Riviera Maya. Tulum is known for its new world ethos and
      luxury experiences. Cancun is known for its party scene and all-inclusive
      beach resorts. While Tulum is almost exclusively oriented around tourism,
      Cancun is a major city of about a million people. Petty crime can strike
      the careless tourist, but more serious crimes are rare.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      <b>Valladolid &amp; Campeche</b> &mdash; are smaller cities on the
      peninsula. Valladolid is a charming colonial town that is a great base for
      exploring cenotes and Mayan ruins. It hosts a lovely square a great cenote
      in the middle of the town. Campeche does not have much tourism, but can be
      a lovely visit especially if you&rsquo;re looking to soak in normal
      Mexican life.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      <b>Playa del Carmen, Holbox, &amp; Celestún</b> &mdash; are smaller
      coastal towns and provide good opportunities to experience shoes-off beach
      life.
    </Paragraph>
    <Subsubheading>History - Mayan Archaeology</Subsubheading>
    <Paragraph>
      Mayan culture and influence permeates the Yucatan. There are towns in the
      southern interior that host residents that speak exclusively Maya. The
      whole region is littered with Mayan ruins and it&rsquo;s believed that any
      hill witnessed in the flat landscape is a ruin waiting to be uncovered.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      <b>Chichén Itzá</b> &mdash; is a UNESCO World Heritage site and the most
      famous archaeological site in the region. It boasts some of the
      best-preserved ruins in the area. While numerous vendors and crowds can
      dull the experience a bit, there are many day tours that will take you to
      the site and nearby cenotes. It&rsquo;s lovingly restored pyramid is
      iconic and a famous Mayan symbol.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      <b>Ek Balam &amp; Calakmul</b> &mdash; are two other major Mayan sites
      that are less trafficked. Ek Balam is known for its well-preserved stucco
      facades with beautiful bas-relief carvings. Calakmul is a partially
      excavated site with the largest Mayan pyramid, unlike most sites - you can
      climb the pyramid and are rewarded with a view of the Yucatan unlike
      you&rsquo;ll see anywhere else. Be aware that Calakmul is very remote and
      takes you into sparsely populated areas of the jungle highlands and
      you&rsquo;ll need to plan ahead. You&rsquo;ll share the space with
      monkeys, tarantulas, and jaguars.
    </Paragraph>
    <Subsubheading>Nature - Cenotes &amp; Jungle</Subsubheading>
    <Paragraph>
      A cenote is a sinkhole that either exposes an aquifer or have filled with
      rainwater over the eons. They provide a source of fresh water and many can
      be swum in as a way to cool off during the hot days. The geology of the
      Yucatan peninsula make it home to over 10,000 cenotes. It is a nearly
      unique geographic feature of the region and <b>not to be missed</b>.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The forest &amp; jungles of the Yucatan are arid regions that can host a
      plethora of bird and animal life. Coati are a relative of the raccoon that
      often gets mistaken for a monkey and are prevalent in the region. True
      monkeys are not common around the populated areas and to guarantee a
      sighting, you&rsquo;ll need to travel into the southern end of the
      peninsula where the elevation and rainfall increase.
    </Paragraph>
    <Subsubheading>Nature - Beach, Sea, &amp; Scuba</Subsubheading>
    <Paragraph>
      The Yucatan peninsula sits at the gateway of the Gulf of Mexico and the
      Caribbean. The beaches are some of the most beautiful in the world and the
      water is warm and clear. From most coastal towns and islands there are
      numerous opportunities for boating &amp; fishing.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      <b>Cozumel &amp; Isla Mujeres</b> &mdash; <em>islands</em> &mdash; Cozumel
      is a large sparsely populated island about a 45 minute ferry ride from
      Playa del Carmen. It is well-known as one of the best destinations for
      scuba diving in the Caribbean. Isla Mujeres is a smaller island served by
      ferry from Cancun, it&rsquo;s a sandbar island and serves as a casual
      retreat. It&rsquo;s most well known as serving as the launch point for
      whale shark diving, but unfortunately we will not be there for the whale
      shark season.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      <b>Bull shark diving</b> &mdash; our wedding falls during the bull shark
      diving season. Female bull sharks swim into the mangrove swamps to give
      birth and then hang out in the clear shallows to recuperate. Due to the
      nature of their visit and the clear water these sharks present little risk
      to swimmers and divers. It provides one of the best opportunities to
      safely experience an apex predator in its natural habitat. Dive operations
      in Playa del Carmen and Cancun specialize in this type of diving during
      the season.
    </Paragraph>
    <Subsubheading>Luxury - Riviera Maya</Subsubheading>
    <Paragraph>
      For those who prefer to be pampered, Riviera Maya lies on the eastern
      shore of the peninsula and is home to enumerable all-inclusive resorts for
      all tastes. Cancun, Playa del Carmen, and Tulum are known for their
      nightlife &amp; host some of the wildest parties in all of Mexico.
      Additionally, there is a collection of theme parks under the Xcaret brand
      that offer water parks, ropes courses, ATV adventures, and many more.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Due to the concentration of tourism in these towns, they can serve as
      great home bases for tours that lead into inland adventures such as Mayan
      ruins and cenotes.
